            Heyy there Techy Boy Here, My Name is <span className="font-bold">Sunil</span>, but you can also call me <span className="font-bold">Techy</span>

          <p className="mb-4 font-inter">
            Did you know that <span className="underline decoration-slate-50 decoration-opacity-50">more than 60% of graduates</span> struggle to find a job even after finishing their graduation?
            </p>
          <p className="mb-4 font-inter">
          These days, getting a job isn’t as easy as it used to be. Companies no longer require large teams for most tasks. With AI, one person can now handle the work of five people.
           </p>
          <p className="mb-4 font-inter">
          And in the near future, even that one person could be replaced entirely by AI for sure.
          This is one of the major factor behind my decision to start a mission to Empower 1 Million students with AI skills over the next 3 years.
